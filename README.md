- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyberShadow7
- 👀 I’m interested in Penetration Testing and Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Penetration Testing (Hack The Box) and Go, Rust, Assembly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can. Contact me and I will reply if I know how to help
- 📫 How to reach me : Preferably through GitHub. Send me a message!

I am currently working on mini-games which work mostly on command-line. I have made my own MSF modules as well (in Ruby but I don't remember much specifics of the MSF3 engine).

I also make some automations tools which I find useful.

Open to opportunities!

Thank you for your time :)
