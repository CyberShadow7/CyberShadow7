- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyberShadow7
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cyber Security (Hack The Box) and Go, Ruby, Python3
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can. Contact me and I will reply if I know how to help.
- 📫 How to reach me : Preferably through GitHub but my Instagram is @pr0j3ct1. Send me a message saying you found me through GitHub and you are looking to collaborate so that I accept you ;)

I am currently working on mini-games which work mostly on command-line. I have made my own MSF modules as well (in Ruby but I don't remember much specifics of MSF3).
I also make some automations in case someone needs that automation because of IoT or other personal reasons.
Contact me if you need an automation of some commands into one and preferably also tell me the language you would like it in.


Thank you for your time :)
